;
; This file is used to hold the licence key strings which are required by
; QAS products to access any data sets which you have purchased,
; are evaluating, or which you use in a development environment.
;
; Licence keys appear one per line, starting on the first character of the line.
; Blank lines are ignored and comments can be included by inserting a semi-colon
; ";" as the first character of the line, as for this text.
;
; This file normally resides in the application directory alongside the
; executable and/or library files originally installed with your QAS
; product, and each application will normally possess its own, individual
; licence file.
;
; Licence key strings are of the general form (without quotation marks):
;
; "A2B496CA-29019L-PRO-AUSBSP-EVAL-13APR2003-WIN"
;
; where each field (separated by the "-" character) provides information about
; the licence.
;
; The fields are:
;
; "A2B496CA-29019L-PRO-AUSBSP-EVAL-13APR2003-WIN"
;      ^                                  an encrypted authentification code
;             ^                           your QAS customer code
;                   ^                     the product the licence is issued for
;                        ^                the data set the licence is issued for
;                               ^         [optional] evaluation licence
;                                     ^   [optional] expiry date of the licence
;                                             ^      platform, e.g. Windows
; (Note: the above example code is not valid.) 
;
; Some fields can be omitted, for example if no expiry date is shown then the
; licence key will continue to allow access to the data indefinitely (see note
; at the end of this text).  Similarly "EVAL" will not appear in a full licence.
;
; Keys are case-insensitive, and so can be entered in upper, lower or a mixture
; of cases.
;
; Licence keys are provided on the dispatch note which accompanies newly-purchasd
; data when it is first sent to you.  Sometimes it may be supplied via an email,
; when you can simply cut and paste the keys during installation.
;
; Windows Data Installer Users
; ----------------------------
; If you use the Windows data installer (provided with all QAS data)
; then you will be asked during the installation procedure to enter a licence
; key for each data set/product combination for which you have purchased a
; licence.
;
; For example, if you are using both Pro and Batch and have purchased GBR data
; for both products then you will be asked to enter a separate GBR licence key
; for each product, Pro and Batch.
;
; If for any reason you do not wish to enter the licence keys during the data
; installation process, they can be entered at any time via the respective
; configuration editor of each application.  In that case you should take care
; that you enter the correct product licence key string, since licence keys
; for different products (i.e. Pro, Web or Batch products) are mutually
; incompatible.
;
; Non-Windows Data Installer Users
; --------------------------------
; If you are a UNIX user, or you do not install data using the Windows installer
; utility and cannot use the configuration editor, then you will need to
; manually edit this file to insert the licence keys supplied with your data.
;
; Each key should appear on its own line, starting on the first character of the
; line.
; 
; Again you should take care to enter licence keys only for the product
; which uses this licence file.
